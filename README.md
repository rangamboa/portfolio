# Personal Portfolio

## Task

To build a portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. This is especially important for those developers like me who will just be starting out in the industry and need a way to showcase the projects that have been successful.

This assignment was to attempt to emulate the mock website shown in the homework instructions, including general layout and functionality.

## Resources

I used several tutorial websites on the web to assist in coding for this assignment, such as:

* W3Schools

* MDN

* as well as the tutorials and sample code gone over in class sessions.
